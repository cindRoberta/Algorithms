Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**
- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The input binary string <strong>00000000000000000000000000001011</strong> has a total of three '1' bits.
</pre>

**Example 2:**
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The input binary string <strong>00000000000000000000000010000000</strong> has a total of one '1' bit.
</pre>

**Example 3:**
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
<strong>Output:</strong> 31
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The input binary string <strong>11111111111111111111111111111101</strong> has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
</pre>

**Constraints:**
- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?
